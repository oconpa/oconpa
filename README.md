## Hello There 👋

Welcome to the profile. Fairly odd human who likes to build, break and admire the complex debugging of an infinite re-renders bug (nested useEffects 👀)
I'm a developer at heart in the full stack web space. Working with technologies like React, AWS and Serverless for a while. You'll find me currently building on emerging tech as a prototyping engineer (VR/AR, BlockChain, Data, ML/AI).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on VR/AR, BlockChain, Data, ML/AI, but at ❤️ a WebDev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spacial Computing. Think [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) && [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com)
